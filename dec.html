    <h1>&nbsp;The Decleration of Independence of the Rebublic of Xemnas</h1>

    <br>
<div class=paragraphtwo>
    <p> &emsp; In order of this document, the Republic of Xemnas would like to request to be considered a nation in of itself. In our republic, we are always striving to be better and because of &nbsp;&nbsp;this, we are always looking for ways to improve our republic. </p>
<br>
       <p> &emsp; In this strive to be better, the Republic of Xemnas has some qualities that are expected and highly rewarded. We appreciate  the values that we preach in our community, such as &nbsp;&nbsp;loyalty, honesty, discipline, and punctuality of our citizens. 
           These values are upheld and expected from all of our citizens, no matter the circumstances. 
           These values are highly &nbsp;&nbsp;honored and rewarded as needed. 
        In our community, we are different from many other communities. Here, we do not tolerate lies that mean harm to others. 
        We also expect each &nbsp;&nbsp;citizen to give back to the community, as each  citizen must donate blood once they are of legal age and plant a tree for each birthday. </p> 
<br>     
       <p> &emsp; The Republic of Xemnas keeps the core elements of republics of today such as incarceration and mandatory education. 
           However, The Republic of Xemnas also goes above and &nbsp;&nbsp;beyond these core elements, enforcing the no discrimination rules as well as 
           encouraging our citizens to give back to the community by donating blood once they are of legal age &nbsp;&nbsp;and having to plant a tree on their birthdays. </p>
